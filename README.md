# Resource: Windows Environment Setup Instructions

This section and the previous one contain the lessons that walk through the
environment setup process for Windows and MacOS, respectively.

You should have set up your local environment when you were completing the
Prework, so this information is included here for your convenience.

If you do need to re-do your environment setup now or in the future (e.g., if
you get a new computer), you can easily access the most up-to-date instructions
here.
